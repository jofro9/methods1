# Part A
``` {r, echo = TRUE}
library(datasets)
sleep <- datasets::sleep
head(sleep)

sleep1 <- subset(sleep, group == "1")
sleep2 <- subset(sleep, group == "2")
t.test(sleep1$extra, sleep2$extra)
```

# Part B
``` {r, echo = TRUE}
t.test(sleep1$extra, sleep2$extra, paired = TRUE)
```

# Part C
For the 'unpaired' t-test, we are assuming the two groups are independent of eachother, with equal variance. For a 'paired' t-test, memebers from the same group are typically tested. The results from the first, unpaired test were not significant at a alpha level of 0.05. However, when paired, there is evidence of a difference in the mean effect between the two sample groups at an alpha level of 0.05, with a confidence interval of [-2.460, -0.700].
