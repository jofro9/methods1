```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)
```
# Part C
```{r}
set.seed(8675309)

rand <- rexp(100000, 3)
rand.mean <- mean(rand)
rand.var <- var(rand)
rand.mean
rand.var
```
The simulated values are very close to the calculated expectations for mean and varicance from parts A and B.
  
# Part D
The expected wait time does not change from part A, based on a time parameter (t) when using the exponential distribution. Mathematically there is no time parameter for expectations when values are distributed exponentially.
